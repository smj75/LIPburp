# LIPburp

Greenhouse gas emissions from repeated geological events within Large Igneous Provinces.

# ***EXECUTABLES***

# simulate_const_trec.sh

Generates multiple carbon emissions histories for an LIP sill province, assuming constant t_repeat. 

# simulate_var_trec.sh

Generates multiple carbon emissions histories for an LIP sill province, assuming t_repeat varies according to a model for formation of the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) sill province.

# make_dimensions.awk

Translates a list of random numbers into sill dimensions and host rock characteristics for each sill.  

# dim2mtp.awk

Converts sill dimension list from make_dimensions.awk into a parameters required by emissions parameterisation.

# LIP_emissions_model.awk

(a) Assigns times and locations to sill parameter list from dim2mtp.awk.
(b) Calculates combined emissions history.

# all_histories.gmt

Plots multiple carbon emissions histories generated by LIP_emissions_model.awk using GMT (Generic Mapping Tools).
